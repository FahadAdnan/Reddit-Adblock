# Chrome-Extension-YoutubeDownloader
A chrome extension that automatically downloads Youtube videos for you with the use of an external website. 
Checks when a pages and links are loaded using Mutation Observers along with a variety of other tools.

Note: The chrome store REJECTED my extension as it breaks their downloading from youtube regulations. 
So I made it possible for you to download it on your own.

Steps to get UtubeDownloader:

1) Download zip file of extension
2) Extract file which should give you a folder
3) Go to chrome://extensions
4) On the top right corner click the Developer mode switch
5) Press the new revelaed load unpacked button
6) Select the unzip folder and enjoy

Feel free to modify the code to your liking. :)
