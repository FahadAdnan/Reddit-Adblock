# Reddit-AdBlocker
### Chrome extension

A chrome extension made to block ads and promoted posts on reddit pages, because they are pretty weird. 

### ðŸ’»  Tech 
This application is a [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions?hl=en) made with Javascript. <br/>
Used the [Mutation Observer Library](https://developer.android.com/training/volley) to detect changes to the Html DOM <br/>
Used [Content Scripts](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/content_scripts) to alter/remove elements on pages under Reddit domain  <br/>
Used [Background Scripts](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/background_pages) to detect changes from dynamic loading (AJAX) <br/>


Note: The chrome store isnt yet ACCEPTED by the chrome store.
So I made it possible for you to download it on your own.
