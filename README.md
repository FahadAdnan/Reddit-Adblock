# Reddit-AdBlock

A chrome extension made to block ads and promoted posts on reddit, because they are pretty weird. 

Uses mutation observers, and a background script to detect a dynamic changes (e.g AJAX) to re-inject ad-blocking code when a Reddit web page dynamically reloads. The content script does not check for dynamic reloading, so I made a background page to do check for when that occurs.


Note: The chrome store isnt yet ACCEPTED by the chrome store.
So I made it possible for you to download it on your own.

Steps to get UtubeDownloader:

1) Download zip file of extension
2) Extract file which should give you a folder
3) Go to chrome://extensions
4) On the top right corner click the Developer mode switch
5) Press the new revelaed load unpacked button
6) Select the unzip folder and enjoy

Feel free to modify the code to your liking. :)
